# Project Requirements

## Development Requirements

1. Use Pandas to **clean and format** datasets.
2. Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process.
3. Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final analysis**.
4. Use `PyViz`, `GeoViews`, and `Hvplot` to create 6-8 visualizations of the data (ideally, at least two per "question").
5. Include exported PNG files in `README.md` and presentation.
6. *Optional:* Use at least one API.
7. Use one new Python library that hasn't been covered in class.
8. `README.md` should include:
    1. Summary of major findings
    2. Questions as headings
    3. Short descriptions of findings and relevant plots

## Presentation Requirements

1. Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them.
2. Where, and how, the data was to found to answer these questions.
3. The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook).
4. The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook).
5. Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of the summary.
6. The implications of your findings: What do the findings mean? How do they impact finance?

## Data Suggestions

1. Sufficiently large
2. Consistent format
3. Ideally, contain more data than required
4. Well documented
